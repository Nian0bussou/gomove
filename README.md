# GoMove

---

this is a program to categorize images by their width, height & ratio


Since, it is made for doing multiple directories in parallel

by default it is using this patern:

your-path/
├── subdir1
├── subdir2
└── subdir3

where "your-path/" is the default path ("D:/grapper" or "/mnt/d/grapper/") or the one specified  

it will **only** sort the subdirectories (in this example: subdir1, subdir2 & subdir3)


by default it will organize the category using this patern:

subdir/
├── bad_quality
│   ├── l
│   ├── p
│   └── s
├── other
├── square
├── video
└── wall


(the structure of the directories in this README were made using the 'tree' package)
